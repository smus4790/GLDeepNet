# GLDeepNet
Mapping Glacial Lake using Optical, Elevation and Synthetic Aperture Radar Data
GLDeepNet is a fully automated deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) designed for precise and scalable glacial lake mapping using multisource remote sensing data. The model integrates optical, thermal, SAR, and DEM data, leveraging SAR coherence to improve lake delineation in challenging conditions, such as cloud cover and seasonal variations. Through a carefully optimized architecture with adaptive kernel sizes and morphological post-processing, GLDeepNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in glacial lake detection.

This project aims to support climate change research, hazard assessment, and long-term monitoring of glacial lakes, offering an efficient, open-source solution for scientists, researchers, and policymakers.
